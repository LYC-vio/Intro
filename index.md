Hi and welcome to my personal website!

I'm a reasearch assistant at [Maizie Zhou's lab](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/maizie-zhou-lab/), Vanderbilt University. My research interests lie primarily in the area of computational genomics, computational neuroscience and deep learning etc. I did my bachelors at School of Information and Communication Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)

## Education
### University of Electronic Science and Technology of China 
2016-2020 Sichuan, China
- Bachelor of Science in Information and Communication Engineering
- 2017, 2018&2019 Outstanding Students Scholarship (Top 9%)

### Vanderbilt University
Feb 2021 - Now TN, USA
- Computer Science PhD candidate, 2021 spring semester admission

## Research Experience
1. **Research Assistant at MediaLab** (Jan 2019-Jun 2020 Sichuan, China)
    - Participated in the design of a Deep Neural Networks based car brand recognition system
2. **Summer intern at Stanford** (Jul-Sep 2019 CA, USA)
    - Participated in the design of Aquila_stLFR, a diploid genome assembly based structural variant calling package for stLFR linked-reads and published it to Bioconda.
3. **Research Assistant at Maizie Zhou’s Lab** (Feb 2021 - Now TN, USA)
    - Simulated the short-term working memory by training Recurrent Neural Networks on series of cognitive tasks, and analyzed the neuron patterns in different maturation stages
    - Evaluated current state-of-art long read based structural variant callers against multiple long read sequencing datasets, and designed comprehensive comparisons to reveal their properties under different scenarios
